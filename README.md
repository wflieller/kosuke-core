# Kosuke - The First Open-Source Vibe-Coding Platform

> The project is currently under heavy development, so expect a lot of changes and breaking changes. v2.0.0 is coming soon with a managed version of the project.

Today the first open-source vibe-coding platform, tomorrow the next geneation "IDE" for Web Applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running Locally

> Make sure to check the Stripe Integration section before running these commands. As of now, you need to provide all the Stripe keys in order to have the commands running smoothly.

```bash
# run postgres and minio
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d minio postgres agent
# run the database migrations
npm run db:push
# seed the db with a User.
npm run db:seed
```

This will create the following user:

- User: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `admin12345`

You can, of course, create new users as well through `/sign-up`.

For the storage of static files such as profile pictures we are using MinIO. For this reason, after you have the docker-compose up and running, you can visit `http://localhost:9001` with the `.env` credentials and create a new bucket `uploads` which will be used by the web application and make it public.

Finally, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Docker Preview Setup

For project previews, we use Docker containers to isolate and run Next.js applications. You need to make sure to have docker installed and pull the right image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/filopedraz/kosuke-template:v0.0.5
```

This image will be used for all project previews, providing consistent development environments for your generated applications.

### Stripe Integration

For handling subscriptions, we use Stripe. Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

To test webhooks locally, you can use the Stripe CLI to forward events to your local server:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

This will provide you with a webhook secret that you can use in your `.env` file.

### Linting and Pre-commit Hook

To set up the linting pre-commit hook:

```bash
npm install
npm run prepare
```

This configures a Git pre-commit hook that runs linting and prevents commits with issues. To bypass in exceptional cases:

```bash
git commit -m "Your message" --no-verify
```

## 🎯 Roadmap (Thinking...)

- [ ] **Brand Guidelines Generator**: include in the pipeline a step related to Font and color palette generation based on the project description.
- [ ] **Ollama Support**: support Ollama as backend for code generation.
- [ ] **Database and backend support**: build full-stack web applications, not only static pages.

## 🤖 Code-Gen Agentic Pipeline

Kosuke uses a sophisticated agentic pipeline for code generation that operates through a series of structured phases:

### How the Pipeline Works

1. **Initialization & Context Gathering**

   - The system processes the user request and initializes the agent with a project ID
   - Project context (directory structure) is automatically gathered
   - Recent chat history is retrieved to provide continuity

2. **Thinking Phase (Iterative)**

   - The agent enters an iterative "thinking" mode to gather information
   - It can read files to understand the codebase structure and context
   - The system carefully tracks which files have been read to avoid redundant operations
   - Context accumulates with each iteration, building a comprehensive understanding
   - Safeguards prevent infinite loops by limiting iterations (max 25)

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Once sufficient context is gathered, the agent switches to "execution" mode
   - A structured list of actions is generated (create/edit/delete files or directories)
   - Each action is executed sequentially using appropriate tools
   - After execution, a concise summary of changes is generated and presented
